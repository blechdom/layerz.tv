dd: hello
dd: how come I don't have that option
dd: this is great
dd: I don't see as many background options as you've been showing?  Should I drop some in?
dd: do I click to select or do I drag and drop it in to participate?
kristin: yeah... sometimes the upload messes up... but yeah, drop em in the drop box
kristin: if you have "backgrounds" selected it will add to backgrounds
kristin: and same for midgrounds and foregrounds
kristin: i was thinking foregrounds don't loop
dd: It very pleasurable when the site responds to my actions....just sayin....
dd: I agree - foregrounds should not loop.
dd: I'm only seeing 3 midgrounds and two backgrounds
dd: that is so great
kristin: yeah....
kristin: lets fill 'er up with content
kristin: some content makes it carsh though, and some content makes multiple thumbnails show up
kristin: i wanna catch the crashers before they upload
kristin: It's super fun!
kristin: now onto webcam
dd: how are you syncing the content - it's fantastic
dd: how did you time it so the wrecking ball takes out the car?
dd: the animation is hilarious and the google chrome ad too
kristin: ha! the car is in the original wrecking ball footage
kristin: yeah... i think it shows a lot of potential
dd: $$$$
